# Miscellaneous Dotfiles

I live by the terminal, and therefore by my personal configs. Here is a collection of them.

## ZSH

Aliases, functions, PS1 prompt, git integration, and more.

## Vim

Syntax highlighting, line numbers, history files, auto indentation, etc.

## Terminator

Focus follow mouse, custom color scheme, fixed keybindings, transparency, yadda. 

## iterm2

Colors, shortcuts, ya know. The usual.

## Sublime Text Editor

Basically just fixing annoying defualt features.
